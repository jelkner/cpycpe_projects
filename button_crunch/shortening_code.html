<h2>Shortening the Intro</h2>
<p>Let's get started with shortening our code!</p>
<pre>
import time
import board
import neopixel
import digitalio
import random
</pre>
  <p>In order to access and use a lot of the functions of our circuit 
  playground express, we have to import some modules. [time] is for the
  timer that records the speed of the player and returns the value at the
  end of a round. [board] identifies the circuit playground express, we
  use it for locations and communicating directly with the circuit board.
  [neopixel] gives us access to manipulate and use the set of 10 LED
  lights. [digitalio] gives us access to the two buttons on our circuit 
  playground express.</p>
<pre>
led = neopixels.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 10) #7
led.brightness = 0.01  #8

button_b = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.BUTTON_B) #10
button_b.direction = digitalio.Direction.INPUT #11
button_b.pull = digitalio.Pull.Down #12

button_a = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.BUTTON_A) #14
butotn_a.direction = digitalio.Direction.INPUT #15
button_a.pull = digitalio.Pull.DOWN #16
</pre>
  <p>Lines and their meanings:</p>
    <li>Line 7 - This simply states the number of LED lights we will
    be using and assigning the LED lights to a variable simply names
    [led]. We are using 10 LED lights for this game.</li>
    <li>Line 8 - This sets the brightness of the lights. We decided to be
    chill and set it to a basic setting of [0.01]</li>
    <li>Line 10 - This is where we access our first button. We are using
    [BUTTON_B] and we assigned the button to a variable named [button_b]</li>
    <li>Line 11 - This line states that the button is an input. So we
    cannot send information to it, we receive information from it.</li>
    <li>Line 12 - This line states the when the button is pushed, it is on.
    When the button is not pushed, it is off.</li>
    <li>Line 14, Line 15, Line 16 - These lines have the same meaning as
    lines 10, 11, and 12 but instead of using [BUTTON_B] we are using [BUTTON_A].     We assign the line to a variable named [button_a]</li>
<pre>
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
OFF = (0, 0, 0)
</pre>
    <p>This stuff is fun. Writing all the colors out can get tedious and is not
    very reader-friendly so we made some more variables. [GREEN] is set to its
    RGB value of green. [WHITE] is set to the RGB value of white. [OFF] is set
    to the RGB value of black.</p>
<pre>
def Lights_On(pos):
    for i in range(10):
        led[i] = OFF
    for i in range(pos):
        led[i] = WHITE
</pre>
    <p>[pos] is the number of LED you are on.</p>
    <p>When the variable [Lights_on] receives the number in [pos] it turns the that set number of lights on. Every time [pos] is changed, the LED lights will completely turn off and then turn back on with the new number of lights on.
