<h2>Shortening the Body</h2>
<p>Let's get started with shortening our main code!</p>
<pre>
def Obstacle(pos, turn):
    lost_points = 0
    led[pos] = GREEN
    while True:
        if button_b.value:
            time.sleep(0.2)
            lost_points += 1
            Lights_On(turn - (lost_points + 1))
            led[pos] = GREEN
        if button_a.value:
            time.sleep(0.2)
            return lost_points
</pre>
  <p>Time for our obstacle!</p> 
  <p>We define [Obstacle] that excepts the arguments [pos] and [turn].</p>
  <p>[pos] is which light is gonna be the green obstacle. [turn] changes with
  the number of white lights on.</p> 
  <p>When there is a green light and button_b is pressed, then you will lose a
  point meaning 1 white light will disappear.</p>
  <p>We add [time.sleep(0.2)] because if we didn’t then the changes would be so
  fast that we wouldn’t see them!</p>
<pre>
def Round(obstacles):
    turn = 1
    obstacle_rounds = set()
    if obstacles != 0:
        while True:
            obstacle_rounds.add(random.randint(1,8))
            if len(obstacle_rounds) == obstacles:
                break
    while True:
        if turn in obstacle_rounds:  
            turn -= Obstacle(random.randint(turn + 1, 9), turn) #51
            turn += 1
            if turn &lt; 1:
                turn = 1
            Lights_On(turn - 1)
        elif button_b.value:
            time.sleep(0.2)
            turn += 1
            if turn == 11:
                break
            Lights_On(turn - 1)
</pre>
  <p>We define a function called [Round()] this is what actually makes our game run.</p>
  <p>This chunk has many parts. If it is round 0 or [Round(0)] is called
  at the end, then the green light obstacle will never appear. This gets the
  player comfortable with using the button to gain LED lights.</p>
  <p>In Line 51, the obstacle can appear in places from where the play is
  to the end. 
  <p>When there is a green light and button_a is pressed, then the green
  obstacle disappears and 1 white light is added.</p>
<pre>
timer = time.monotonic() #63

Round(3) #65
print(time.monotonic() - timer) #66
</pre>
    <p>This stuff is fun. Writing all the colors out can get tedious and is not
    very reader-friendly so we made some more variables. [GREEN] is set to its
    RGB value of green. [WHITE] is set to the RGB value of white. [OFF] is set
    to the RGB value of black.</p>
<pre>
def Lights_On(pos):
    for i in range(10):
        led[i] = OFF
    for i in range(pos):
        led[i] = WHITE
</pre>
    <li>Line 63 - this line sets our timer.</li>
    <li>Line 65 - This is probably the most important line of our entire code.
        In [Round()] we can set a value from 0 - 3. Depending on what round
        is put in, the obstacle will be more frequent and more difficult.
        Round(0) has no obstacles. Round(1) has the obstacle of making an
        appearance only once. Round(2) has the obstacle to make an appearance
        twice. As you increase the number, the number of appearances of
        the obstacle will be the same. WARNING: this can only go from 0 - 8.
        Any number higher or lower will break the code.</li>
    <li>Line 66 - When opening the serial tool, it will print the value
        from subtracting our start time from our current time. This will
        print when the round is over.</li>
