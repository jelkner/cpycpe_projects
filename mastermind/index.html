		<h2>What You Will Do</h2>
    <p>You will learn to make the game Mastermind on the <b>Circuit Playground Express</b>.
    </p>

		<h2>How to play</h2>
		<p> The game master mind is a two player game of making and cracking codes. There is a code maker
    that creates a color code and a code cracker which is supposed to guess the color code.</p>
    <p> The code maker creates the  code by using the two main buttons, the left one changes the color
    you select and the right one is to select the color. There's a third attached button that is a 
    submit button for the code
    </p>
    <h3>Rules:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The code maker goes first, they decide what the secret code will be, and they cannot show
        the code breaker</li>
        <li>The code breaker then tries to guess the code the code maker submitted and once they guess
        they guess the code they win! Each time there's a guess though there are lights that give 
        you hints on what's right or wrong</li>
        <li>A red light means that color is nowhere in the code</li>
        <li>A blue light means there's that color in the code but not in that spot</li>
        <li>A green light means the color is in the code in that spot</li>
    </ul>
