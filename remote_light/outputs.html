<h2>Outputs</h2>
<p>
  In order to control our relay, we need to be able to get an output from our 
  board. I’ll explain why we need an output from our board to <a href=relays.html>control our 
  relay</a> in the future. 
</p>

<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>
    To get an output from the Circuit Playground Express we, of course, need to code it! 
    The code for this is simple. You just need to import “board” and “digitalio”. Board 
    allows you to access the outputs and Digital IO you control the outputs. We can 
    import them like any other library in python. 
</p>
<pre>
  import board
  import digitalio
</pre>
<p>
    Now we need to assign the board IO as a variable, so we can call it easily. Let's use 
    relay. On the Circuit Python Express there seem to be few digital ports, digital ports 
    are important because they exist in binary unlike analog ports which exist in a range. This 
    makes them harder to control. However the IO port A1 can also be called D12, so we're going 
    to use D12 as out IO port.
</p>
<pre>
    relay = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D12)
</pre>
<p>
  The Circuit Python Express is really cool because it can use ports and chech for both input and 
  output, however in this case we just need the output, not any input so we're going to establish 
  it as such.
</p>
<pre>
    relay.direction = digitalio.Direction.OUTPUT
</pre>
<p>
  In order to have our relay off at the start we're just going to set the value to False, so there is 
  no output from D12.
</p>
<pre>
    relay.value = False
</pre>

<h2>Product</h2>
<p>
  In case the lesson was a little difficult to follow here's where we're at right now!
</p>
<pre>
    import board
    import digitalio

    relay = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D12)
    relay.direction = digitalio.Direction.OUTPUT
    relay.value = False
</pre>
