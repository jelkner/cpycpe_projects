<h2>How Does a Relay Work</h2>
<p>
  The way relays work is actually really easy to understand! Relays are electrically operated switches, 
  meaning that when a current is passed through the relay it flips a switch and it allows the current 
  through. We are using a relay to prevent burnout in the Circuit Playground Express board. The 
  electric grid has a  voltage of 110 volts and that would be damaging to the board if used as an input 
  the board has a voltage output of 3.3 volts so it wouldn't be enough power out to power much of anything. 
  Using a relay allows you to circumvent all of those issues.  
</p>

<h2>Connecting the Relay to the CPX</h2>
<p>
  This is how we're going to connect the relay to the Circuit Playground Express (CPX):
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Connect the 3 Female to Female Jumper Wires to all 3 pins on the relay. Keep in mind which pin is for 
    what: S (control), + (power), and - (ground).
  </li>
  <li>
    Connect the black alligator clip’s male end to the female jumper cable that connects to the - (ground) 
    pin, in our case, it’s the brown one female jumper cable.
  </li>
  <li>
      Connect the red alligator clip’s male end to the female jumper cable that connects to the + (power) 
      pin, in our case, it’s the red one female jumper cable.
  </li>
  <li>
      Connect the yellow alligator clip’s male end to the female jumper cable that connects to the S 
      (control) pin, in our case, it’s the orange one female jumper cable.
  </li>
  <li>
      Now connect the black alligator clip’s alligator side to the GND (ground) IO on the Circuit 
      Playground Express.
  </li>
  <li>
      Connect the red alligator clip’s alligator side to the 3.3V (power) IO on the Circuit Playground 
      Express.
  </li>
  <li>
      Connect the yellow alligator clip’s alligator side to the A0 (D12 / control) IO on the Circuit 
      Playground Express
  </li>
</ol>
<p>

<h2>Connecting the Relay to Extension Cord</h2>
<p>
  So now we need to hook up our extension cord to the relay, so we can turn it on and off. Because of 
  the use of high voltage we need to make sure everything possible is disconnected from the wall and 
  to make sure that at the end there is no exposed wire.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Cut the extension cord in half.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cut both already cut extension cord parts down the seam, about 1 inch down, so you have two semi 
    separate wires.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cut partway into the each wire about an quarter inch down the cuts so you can rip the shielding 
    off the wire, you should now have 4 wires with a little bit of exposed wire.
  </li>
  <li>
    Now using some electrical tape cover shielding just under the exposed wire wrap it all the way around.
    <br><img src="images/ext4.jpg" alt="Diagram of this step" width=75%>
  </li>
  <li>
    Now connect pairs from each of the opposing halves and wrap electrical tape around each of the pairs 
    from the opposing halves.
    <br><img src="images/ext5.jpg" alt="Diagram of this step" width=75%>
  </li>
  <li>
    On one of the halves place the Wire Connector and then twist until it feels tight. Make sure to stop 
    twisting when it feels tight as to not over twist, over twisting may damage the wires.
    <br><img src="images/ext6.jpg" alt="Diagram of this step" width=75%>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  We're now ready to put the two exposed wires into the relay.
</p>

<h2>Putting The Exposed Wire Into The Relay</h2>
<p>
  On the relay side, there are 3 terminals, NO, COM, and NC, on the Parallax Relay we are using COM is 
  unmarked, so you will only see NO and NC. COM is for power input, this is where the power goes into 
  the relay. NO is the power output for when the relay is powered on, this is where we’ll put our power 
  output. NC is the power output for when the relay is not powered on, we won’t be plugging anything 
  into this one. Follow the steps to input the exposed wire into the relay:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Using a small screwdriver make sure all of the terminals are opened.
    <br><img src="images/rel1.jpg" alt="Diagram of this step" width=75%>
  </li>
  <li>
    Plug one of the ends into the unmarked COM (middle) power terminal and screw down tight, we recommend 
    using the outlet end not the plug end of the extension cord, but as this is AC it doesn’t really 
    matter.
    <br><img src="images/rel2.jpg" alt="Diagram of this step" width=75%>
  </li>
  <li>
    Plug the other end into the NO marked power terminal and screw down tight and make sure all the 
    terminals are closed.
    <br><img src="images/rel3.jpg" alt="Diagram of this step" width=75%>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Now the relay is all up and running, we just need to write the code to <a href="bcontrol.html">control the 
    relay</a> and then control the relay with the remote.
